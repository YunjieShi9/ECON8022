# Real Business Cycles

Problems 1 and 3 are potentially assessable. Give them a good go and prep for class! 

* Problem 1 uses a simple technique called local perturbation solutions (which originates from solving differential equations in math and physics).

    * This requires only high-school (A-levels) math in terms of Taylor series expansions/approximation and linear algebra.

    * More info in [your readings here](https://phantomachine.github.io/econ8022/rbc.html#an-example-recursive-economy).

* Problem 3 uses tools and lessons that you have already learned in dynamic programming theory.
