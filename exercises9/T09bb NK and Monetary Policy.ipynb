    "Consider a version of the RBC model where prices are \"sticky\". To rationalize why prices are sticky, here's a story that builds on Chamberlin's 1933 monopolistic competition model of industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lectures, we considered a version of sticky-price firms due to [Calvo](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3932(83)90060-0) and [Yun](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(96)90040-9). Calvo wrote down the original firms' problem in continuous time. Yun adapted it to a RBC, general-equilibrium enviroment. Yun's version and its extensions have since been referred to as \"NK models with Calvo pricing\". If you recall, the story here is that firms are monopolistically competitive. That is a tractable way of thinking about firms with markup, price-setting abilities but not having to deal with strategic pricing behavior. Prices are sticky by assumption. In Calvo's formulation, there is an exogenous time-dependent (but state-independent) signal (from a fixed geometric distribution) for price change. In a way, firms would like to change prices in response to demand or cost shifts, but they potentially can't: Nature will tell them if they can with some probability $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we reconsider the same model but the sticky price setting story is slightly modified. Here, firms can change prices anytime, but they face some convex cost of adjusting prices. This makes price-stickiness state dependent. This version of the story is sometimes referred to as a \"menu cost model\", in the sense that changing prices on one's menu of products is a costly exercise. This version, due to [Rotemberg](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830944), is algebraically simpler and easier to implement than the Calvo-Yun version. It turns out, at least to first order accuracy, the Rotemberg and Calvo-Yun models imply the same aggregate, structural Phillips curve. \n",
